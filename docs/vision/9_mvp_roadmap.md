# ACCU — MVP Scope & Phased Roadmap

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **minimum viable implementation** of ACCU and a phased roadmap for its evolution.

Its goal is to ensure:
- focus
- feasibility
- sustainability

MVP is treated as a **learning system**, not a feature-complete platform.

---

## Definition of MVP in ACCU

The ACCU MVP must prove **three core hypotheses**:

1. Undervalued repositories with real potential can be systematically identified
2. Human + AI curation produces better outcomes than either alone
3. Contributors are willing to collaborate under a fair, transparent value model

Anything not serving these hypotheses is out of scope.

---

## MVP Scope (Included)

### 1. Limited Discovery Pipeline

- One public repository source (e.g. GitHub)
- AI-assisted scouting with manual filters
- Small, curated candidate list (10–30 projects)

---

### 2. Manual Evaluation Workflow

- Technical review templates
- License and author checklists
- Human decision gates

Automation is intentionally minimal.

---

### 3. Community Core (Small & Trusted)

- Invite-only contributors
- Clear role assignment
- Lightweight governance processes

Target size: 10–30 active participants.

---

### 4. Single Project Track

- 1–2 projects onboarded maximum
- Clear lifecycle progression
- Visible contribution and share tracking

---

### 5. Basic Share Accounting

- Contribution Unit (CU) tracking
- Project Share (PS) allocation
- Transparent, human-readable logs

No tokenization in MVP.

---

## Explicit MVP Exclusions

The MVP will **not** include:

- Full automation of agents
- Public onboarding at scale
- Secondary markets or liquidity
- Complex DAO mechanics
- Aggressive monetization
- Multi-platform integrations

These exclusions are deliberate safeguards.

---

## Phase 1 — MVP Validation

**Objectives:**
- Validate core hypotheses
- Stress-test governance
- Identify friction points

**Success Signals:**
- At least one revived project reaching active use
- Contributors remain engaged over time
- No governance deadlocks

---

## Phase 2 — Controlled Expansion

**Additions:**
- Expanded agent capabilities
- More projects (3–7)
- Improved tooling for contribution tracking

Still invite-only.

---

## Phase 3 — Open Participation

**Conditions:**
- Proven governance resilience
- Clear legal patterns
- Stable economic flows

**Additions:**
- Public project nominations
- Broader contributor base
- Refined incentive models

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem Maturity

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple sustainable projects
- Minimal central intervention
- ACCU acts primarily as steward

---

## Kill Criteria

ACCU will pause or reset if:
- Governance becomes unmanageable
- Economic incentives distort behavior
- Core principles are repeatedly compromised

Stopping is preferable to corruption.

---

## Summary

The ACCU roadmap prioritizes:
- learning over scaling
- integrity over speed
- people over metrics

Progress is measured not by growth, but by continuity.
