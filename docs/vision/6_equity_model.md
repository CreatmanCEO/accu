# ACCU — Equity & Share (Payout) Model

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines how economic value is attributed, accumulated, and distributed within ACCU.

The model is designed to reward **real contribution**, protect original authors, and prevent capital-driven capture.

---

## Foundational Principles

1. **Contribution precedes ownership**
2. **Authorship is perpetual**
3. **Value is cumulative, not extractive**
4. **Capital is a contribution type, not a privilege**

---

## Units of Value

ACCU operates with three distinct but connected units:

### 1. Contribution Units (CU)

Non-transferable units representing verified contribution.

Sources of CU:
- code contributions
- documentation
- design
- testing
- infrastructure
- community stewardship

CU decay slowly over time to favor active involvement.

---

### 2. Project Shares (PS)

Project-specific economic participation units.

- Allocated based on CU within a project
- Represent revenue participation, not control
- Non-transferable outside the project

---

### 3. Platform Pool Share (PPS)

Represents participation in the ACCU ecosystem as a whole.

- Accumulated via long-term contribution
- Used for platform-wide revenue distribution

---

## Original Author Rights

Original authors automatically receive:
- Founders PS allocation
- Perpetual attribution
- Veto rights on license-breaking changes

Authors are not required to remain active to retain baseline participation.

---

## Capital Contributions

Capital, compute, or infrastructure contributions:
- Generate CU
- Do not generate governance dominance
- Are capped in influence per project

---

## Revenue Distribution

Project revenue is distributed as follows (default template):

- Original authors: baseline share
- Active contributors: proportional PS
- Platform sustainability pool

Percentages are configurable per project but must be transparent and approved.

---

## Anti-Speculation Safeguards

- No secondary market for PS
- No leverage or derivatives
- No anonymous accumulation

---

## Transparency & Auditing

All allocations are:
- logged
- explainable
- auditable by the community

---

## Summary

The ACCU equity model treats ownership as a **function of care and continuity**, not capital accumulation.
