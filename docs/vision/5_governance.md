# ACCU — Community & Governance Model

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines how the ACCU community participates in decision-making, project evolution, and value governance.

It establishes a balance between openness, responsibility, and long-term sustainability.

---

## Core Principle

Authority in ACCU is **earned through contribution**, not capital or visibility.

Governance is designed to:
- prevent capture by large actors
- reward sustained involvement
- remain adaptable over time

---

## Community Roles

**Description:**
Passive participants following projects and discussions.

**Rights:**
- Read access
- Non-binding feedback

---

### 2. Contributors

**Description:**
Individuals providing tangible input.

**Forms of Contribution:**
- code
- documentation
- testing
- design
- research

**Rights:**
- Contribution tracking
- Eligibility for share allocation

---

### 3. Curators

**Description:**
Trusted members responsible for evaluation and prioritization.

**Requirements:**

---

### 4. Stewards

Long-term guardians of system integrity.

## Decision Processes

### Project Onboarding

- AI-assisted evaluation

## Voting Model

Votes are weighted by:
- contribution history
- role
- project-specific involvement

Capital alone does not increase voting power.

---

## Anti-Capture Safeguards

- Role rotation
- Term limits
- Transparent decision logs
- Public rationale for approvals

---

## Conflict Resolution

Escalation path:
1. Direct discussion
2. Curator mediation
3. Steward arbitration

---

## Transparency

All governance actions are:
- logged
- auditable
- visible to the community

---

## Summary

ACCU governance treats community members as co-stewards, not users.

Power emerges from sustained, meaningful contribution.
