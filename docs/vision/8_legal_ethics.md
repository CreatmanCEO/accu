# ACCU — Legal & Ethical Constraints

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the legal and ethical boundaries within which ACCU operates.

Its purpose is to protect:
- original authors
- contributors
- the community
- the integrity of the open-source ecosystem

---

## Foundational Position

ACCU does not exist above the law, licenses, or ethical norms.

It operates as a **stewardship layer**, not an owner of code by default.

---

## Open-Source License Compliance

### License Respect

- All projects retain their original licenses unless explicitly relicensed by authors.
- License terms are enforced at every lifecycle stage.
- No project enters ACCU without a verified license review.

### Incompatible Licenses

- Projects with incompatible or unclear licensing are restricted to analysis-only mode.
- No commercialization occurs without legal clarity.

---

## Author Consent & Rights

- Original authors must be informed before onboarding.
- Silent forks for commercial use are prohibited.
- Authors retain moral rights and attribution indefinitely.

Authors may decline participation without penalty.

---

## Contributor Protection

- Contributions are tracked and attributed transparently.
- No unpaid labor is converted into private ownership.
- Exit does not erase historical contribution.

---

## AI Usage Ethics

AI agents must:
- disclose AI-assisted output
- avoid training on private or non-consensual data
- respect repository and platform terms of service

No covert automation is allowed.

---

## Data & Privacy

- No collection of unnecessary personal data
- Minimal retention policies
- Transparent data usage disclosures

---

## Economic Ethics

- No predatory monetization
- No dark patterns
- No forced exclusivity

Revenue mechanisms must align with user benefit.

---

## Conflict of Interest

- Mandatory disclosure for stewards and curators
- Recusal required where conflicts exist

---

## Enforcement Model

- Violations trigger review
- Sanctions are proportional and transparent
- Ultimate authority rests with human stewards

---

## Ethical Red Lines

ACCU will not:
- exploit open-source labor
- obscure authorship
- enable surveillance or harm-focused software
- pursue growth at the cost of integrity

---

## Summary

Legal compliance and ethical restraint are not constraints on ACCU — they are its foundation.
