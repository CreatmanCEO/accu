# ACCU Governance Charter

**Version:** 0.1.0 (Draft)
**Status:** Under Discussion

---

## Purpose

This document defines how decisions are made within ACCU, who has authority, and how conflicts are resolved.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Contribution precedes authority** — power comes from doing, not status
2. **Transparency by default** — all significant decisions are documented
3. **Human authority is absolute** — AI proposes, humans decide
4. **No single point of control** — distributed decision-making
5. **Sustainability over speed** — long-term thinking preferred

---

## Roles

### Founder
- Sets vision and values
- Has veto power on ethical issues
- Does NOT manage day-to-day operations

### Stewards (2-5 people)
- Long-term guardians of system integrity
- Resolve disputes
- Time-bound roles (12 months, renewable)

### Curators
- Evaluate and nominate projects

### Contributors
- Anyone providing value (code, docs, research, capital)
- Tracked via Contribution Points (CP)
- No minimum commitment required

### AI Agents

- All outputs require human approval
